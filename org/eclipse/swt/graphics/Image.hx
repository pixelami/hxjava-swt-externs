/**
 * Instances of this class are graphics which have been prepared
 * for display on a specific device. That is, they are ready
 * to paint using methods such as <code>GC.drawImage()</code>
 * and display on widgets with, for example, <code>Button.setImage()</code>.
 * <p>
 * If loaded from a file format that supports it, an
 * <code>Image</code> may have transparency, meaning that certain
 * pixels are specified as being transparent when drawn. Examples
 * of file formats that support transparency are GIF and PNG.
 * </p><p>
 * There are two primary ways to use <code>Images</code>. 
 * The first is to load a graphic file from disk and create an
 * <code>Image</code> from it. This is done using an <code>Image</code>
 * constructor, for example:
 * <pre>
 *    Image i = new Image(device, "C:\\graphic.bmp");
 * </pre>
 * A graphic file may contain a color table specifying which
 * colors the image was intended to possess. In the above example,
 * these colors will be mapped to the closest available color in
 * SWT. It is possible to get more control over the mapping of
 * colors as the image is being created, using code of the form:
 * <pre>
 *    ImageData data = new ImageData("C:\\graphic.bmp"); 
 *    RGB[] rgbs = data.getRGBs(); 
 *    // At this point, rgbs contains specifications of all
 *    // the colors contained within this image. You may
 *    // allocate as many of these colors as you wish by
 *    // using the Color constructor Color(RGB), then
 *    // create the image:
 *    Image i = new Image(device, data);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Applications which require even greater control over the image
 * loading process should use the support provided in class
 * <code>ImageLoader</code>.
 * </p><p>
 * Application code must explicitly invoke the <code>Image.dispose()</code> 
 * method to release the operating system resources managed by each instance
 * when those instances are no longer required.
 * </p>
