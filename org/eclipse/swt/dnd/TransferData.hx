 * The <code>TransferData</code> class is a platform specific data structure for

 * <p>As an application writer, you do not need to know the specifics of 
 * TransferData.  TransferData instances are passed to a subclass of Transfer 
 * and the Transfer object manages the platform specific issues.  
 * You can ask a Transfer subclass if it can handle this data by calling 
 * Transfer.isSupportedType(transferData).</p>
 *
 * <p>You should only need to become familiar with the fields in this class if you 
 * are implementing a Transfer subclass and you are unable to subclass the 
 * ByteArrayTransfer class.</p>
