/**
 *
 * Class <code>DropTarget</code> defines the target object for a drag and drop transfer.
 *
 * <p>IMPORTANT: This class is <em>not</em> intended to be subclassed.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class identifies the <code>Control</code> over which the user must position the cursor
 * in order to drop the data being transferred.  It also specifies what data types can be dropped on 
 * this control and what operations can be performed.  You may have several DropTragets in an 
 * application but there can only be a one to one mapping between a <code>Control</code> and a <code>DropTarget</code>.
 * The DropTarget can receive data from within the same application or from other applications 
 * (such as text dragged from a text editor like Word).</p>
 *
 * <code><pre>
 *	int operations = DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_COPY | DND.DROP_LINK;
 *	Transfer[] types = new Transfer[] {TextTransfer.getInstance()};
 *	DropTarget target = new DropTarget(label, operations);
 *	target.setTransfer(types);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>The application is notified of data being dragged over this control and of when a drop occurs by 
 * implementing the interface <code>DropTargetListener</code> which uses the class 
 * <code>DropTargetEvent</code>.  The application can modify the type of drag being performed 
 * on this Control at any stage of the drag by modifying the <code>event.detail</code> field or the 
 * <code>event.currentDataType</code> field.  When the data is dropped, it is the responsibility of 
 * the application to copy this data for its own purposes.
 *
 * <code><pre>
 *	target.addDropListener (new DropTargetListener() {
 *		public void dragEnter(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 *		public void dragOver(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 *		public void dragLeave(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 *		public void dragOperationChanged(DropTargetEvent event) {};
 *		public void dropAccept(DropTargetEvent event) {}
 *		public void drop(DropTargetEvent event) {
 *			// A drop has occurred, copy over the data
 *			if (event.data == null) { // no data to copy, indicate failure in event.detail
 *				event.detail = DND.DROP_NONE;
 *				return;
 *			}
 *			label.setText ((String) event.data); // data copied to label text
 *		}
 * 	});
 * </pre></code>
