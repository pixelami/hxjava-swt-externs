 * The CCombo class represents a selectable user interface object

 * CCombo was written to work around certain limitations in the native
 * combo box. Specifically, on win32, the height of a CCombo can be set;
 * attempts to set the height of a Combo are ignored. CCombo can be used
 * anywhere that having the increased flexibility is more important than
 * getting native L&F, but the decision should not be taken lightly. 
 * There is no is no strict requirement that CCombo look or behave
 * the same as the native combo box.
