/**
 * Instances of this class are selectable user interface
 * objects that allow the user to enter and modify text.
 * Text controls can be either single or multi-line.
 * When a text control is created with a border, the
 * operating system includes a platform specific inset
 * around the contents of the control.  When created
 * without a border, an effort is made to remove the
 * inset such that the preferred size of the control
 * is the same size as the contents.

 * <dd>CENTER, ICON_CANCEL, ICON_SEARCH, LEFT, MULTI, PASSWORD, SEARCH, SINGLE, RIGHT, READ_ONLY, WRAP</dd>
 * <dt><b>Events:</b></dt>
 * <dd>DefaultSelection, Modify, Verify, OrientationChange</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Note: Only one of the styles MULTI and SINGLE may be specified,
 * and only one of the styles LEFT, CENTER, and RIGHT may be specified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The styles ICON_CANCEL and ICON_SEARCH are hints used in combination with SEARCH.
 * When the platform supports the hint, the text control shows these icons.  When an icon
 * is selected, a default selection event is sent with the detail field set to one of
 * ICON_CANCEL or ICON_SEARCH.  Normally, application code does not need to check the
 * detail.  In the case of ICON_CANCEL, the text is cleared before the default selection
 * event is sent causing the application to search for an empty string.
