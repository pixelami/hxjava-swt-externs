/**
 *
 * Instances of this class implement a selectable user interface
 * object that displays a list of images and strings and issues
 * notification when selected.
 * <p>
 * The item children that may be added to instances of this class
 * must be of type <code>TableItem</code>.
 * </p><p>
 * Style <code>VIRTUAL</code> is used to create a <code>Table</code> whose
 * <code>TableItem</code>s are to be populated by the client on an on-demand basis
 * instead of up-front.  This can provide significant performance improvements for
 * tables that are very large or for which <code>TableItem</code> population is
 * expensive (for example, retrieving values from an external source).
 * </p><p>
 * Here is an example of using a <code>Table</code> with style <code>VIRTUAL</code>:
 * <code><pre>
 *  final Table table = new Table (parent, SWT.VIRTUAL | SWT.BORDER);
 *  table.setItemCount (1000000);
 *  table.addListener (SWT.SetData, new Listener () {
 *      public void handleEvent (Event event) {
 *          TableItem item = (TableItem) event.item;
 *          int index = table.indexOf (item);
 *          item.setText ("Item " + index);
 *          System.out.println (item.getText ());
 *      }
 *  }); 
 * </pre></code>
 * </p><p>
 * Note that although this class is a subclass of <code>Composite</code>,
 * it does not normally make sense to add <code>Control</code> children to
 * it, or set a layout on it, unless implementing something like a cell
 * editor.
